# Found - Frontend

This is the frontend of Found - a simplified version of [_Wellfound_](https://wellfound.com/) (previously AngelList) focused on basic candidate management from a hiring manager's point of view. The user interface is an admin-like dashboard that enables the manipulation of candidates, job postings, an archive of the job postings, and the assignment of candidates to interview stages of a job.

## Technologies Used

* Next.js v2.4.2
* React v18
* TypeScript v5
* Chakra UI v2.10.2

## Usage

The usage of Found will be segmented by the features/functionalities relevant to each page:

* Pipeline
* Candidates
* Jobs
* Archive

The "Candidate" and "Job" objects seen in the forthcoming GIFs are used for demonstration purposes and will not be present on a new running instance of this GitHub project cloned. 

### Pipeline

The "Pipeline" page is the entry point and home page of Found. A hollistic drag and drop column-wise overview of candidates within interview stages of a job or all jobs can be seen.

#### Feature: Viewing interview stages of candidates by job selector

![Example gif of viewing interview stages of candidates by job selector](./public/pipeline_job_selector_feature.gif)

The interview stages of candidates for a certain job can be selected by the top right dropdown menu. The "All" option will show the interview stages of all candidates across all jobs.
If the job selector is unused, it will default to the "All" option.
