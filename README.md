# Found - Frontend

This is the frontend of Found - a simplified version of [_Wellfound_](https://wellfound.com/) (previously AngelList) focused on basic candidate management from a hiring manager's point of view. The user interface is an admin-like dashboard that enables the manipulation of candidates, job postings, an archive of the job postings, and the assignment of candidates to interview stages of a job.
